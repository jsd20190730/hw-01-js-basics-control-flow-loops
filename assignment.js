Problem 1:

Write a program that uses a loop to print out (using console.log()) the multiplication table (12 levels) of a provided number

Variables Required (feel free to add your own variables if needed):
baseNumber (number)

Problem 3:

Write a program that prints out (using console.log()) the winner of a rock paper scissors game between two players

- if the playerA chooses scissors and playerB chooses rock, playerB wins
- if the playerA chooses scissors and playerB chooses scissors, game is a tie
- if the playerA chooses paper and playerB chooses rock, playerA wins
- if the playerA chooses rock and playerB chooses paper, playerB wins
- etc (program should account for all available scenarios)

Variables Required (feel free to add your own variables if needed):
playerAChoice (string)
playerBChoice (string)

Test Cases:
Use the following test cases to confirm your program meets the success criteria

1. Given the following:
